A Morse-based wireless keyboard!
(it's pretty slow)

The setup:
A Raspberry Pi blinks a LED in response to keystrokes it gets from
a keyboard.
An Arduino receives the message, decodes the characters, ands sends them over
its serial interface.

Parts:
- Raspberry Pi
- A bright LED
- ~100R resistor
- 2 ~10K resistors
- 2 photoresistors

Connect the LED and 100R resistor in series between Raspberry pin 7 & ground.

Connect a photoresistor between Arduino's pin A5 and ground,
and a 10K resistor between A5 and +5V.
Connect the second photoresistor between Arduino's pin A0 and ground,
and the other 10K resistor between A0 and +5V.

Orient one of the photoresistors to face the LED.
The other one will sense ambient light.

On the Raspberry, install RPi.GPIO and run the morseled.py script as root.
Or you can set the script to start at boot.

For the Arduino part:
Generate lookup tables:
    python makelookup.py | tee src/lookup.h
Compile, upload, start (using ino):
    ino build && ino upload && ino serial

Sending the numbers 1-4 to the Arduino's over serial will change the
reporting mode.
